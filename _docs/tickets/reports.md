The application ships with several reports which you can run, this page details each
of them. Currently, the only option to access the reports is to export them as a 
csv. See the <admin commands> page for how to do this.
 
### Delegate information

This produces a report of all the delegate information for the ticket holders. This 
could be used for printing name badges or as a door list. 

### Delegate requirements

This report produces a list of all of the delegates who have specified additional 
requirements eg dietary or accessibility requirements. This list is anonymised so 
you can pass it directly to your venue and catering suppliers so that they can 
handle the requirements.

### Missing delegate information

This report finds all the delegates who have not yet provided information for their
tickets and gives you a list so that you can contact them and ask them to provide 
the information.

### Ticket mailout
 
This report was designed to allow you to import all the ticket holders into a 
mailing application so that you can send them information about the event. It 
includes the ticket id for each delegate which you can use as a unique booking 
reference when checking people in at the event.

### Ticket sales 

This report produces a sales report broken down by ticket type and discount code
used.
