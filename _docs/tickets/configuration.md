Example configuration files for the application can be found in the `example-config`
directory. You should copy them to the `config\autoload` directory of the main Zend 
application. Each of the files is covered in this section.

### Main setup

Prior to the application functioning, you will need to complete the configuration 
outlined in the [Setup](/docs/tickets/configuration/setup) page. This is the minimum requirement to get the application
to function.

### Application Setup

Once you have the main setup completed and the application is running, you will
probably want to refer to the [aplication setup](/docs/tickets/configuration/application) page 
to guide you through configuring the tickets you want to sell. 

### Customisation

The application has further optional configuration which you can choose to apply:

 - [Google Analytics](/docs/tickets/configuration/google-analytics)
 - [Email Customisation](/docs/tickets/configuration/email-custom)
 - [Advanced Customisation](/docs/tickets/configuration/advanced)
