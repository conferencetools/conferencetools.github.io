### Overview

This project consists of multiple tools each of them is designed to work as a stand
alone or in conjunction with one or more of the other tools. An example, if you choose
to use our ticket booking application, you can deploy it as a stand alone application
or you can deploy it in conjunction with the sponsor or speaker CRM. Doing so will 
allow you to setup automatic ticket allocations to your speakers and sponsors.

Each of the applications is a Zend framework module which you will be able to use in 
several ways: 
1. Download or fork the matching application repository, which contains
a skeleton for setting up the application as a stand alone application. 
2. Download
 or fork the suite application repository (when available) for setting up the whole
 application suite. 
3. Add it to your own Zend framework application and build it 
 into your own software, this option provides the most flexability, especially if 
 you only wish to deploy a couple of our tools. 
4. Utilise the stand alone 
 applications but configure and deploy them in microservices mode (when available)
