            <blockquote>
              <p>
                  This project aims to provide a suite of tools to assist in running a conference. Each of the tools
                  will stand alone but when deployed as a whole will integrate with each other to provide even
                  greater value. The tools will all be open source and free to use to help conferences keep their
                  costs down. The first tool in the suite was written partly due to the huge fees that some ticket
                  SaaS providers charge.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In addition to providing a suite of great tools, this project also aims to be an example which other
                  developers can learn from. Specifically, each tool will apply techniques to keep code clean
                  and easy to change, following the clean architecture pattern. Where appropriate, more advanced
                  techniques, such as event sourcing will also be used to give developers a real working example
                  they can learn from.
              </p>

            <p>
                This tool focuses on selling tickets to your delegates. The feature set is currently quite small but
                it covers the basics needed by most conferences including free ticket issuing, discount codes and
                downloadable reports. Payments are handled using Stripe.

            <h3 class="text-center">Sponsorship CRM (under development)</h3>
            <p>
                This tool is designed to help you manage sponsorships, from the point you recieve an enquiry or lead about
                a potential sponsor till the point the event happens, this will help you keep track of each of your sponsors,
                collecting key information such as logos, invoices and contracts. It's built in task system reminds you to
                follow up on contacts and hopefully increase the conversion of leads into sponsors.

            <p>
                This tool is designed to do a similar job to the sponsorship CRM but for your speakers; it will be able to
                help keep all the information about each of the speakers organised such as: when they arrive and leave; do
                they need picking up from an airport; have their travel costs been reimbursed and have you booked them a
                hotel room.
